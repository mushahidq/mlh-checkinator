# mlh-checkinator

This scripts logs into my devpost, registers for the MLH hackathon that is currently open and then registers on the official MLH website and also checks me in using the typeform.

Fill in your information and credentials in `info.json` to try out the script and add the environment variables in the `.env` file.

Note: The country field in the code needs to be adjusted since typeform dynamically generates the pages so if you want to change the country try adding or removing the `Keys.DOWN` statements as needed.
